# Image-Classification-with-CNN-using-Keras

Introduction:
Welcome to this tutorial on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras. In this tutorial, we will build a CNN model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 10 different object classes. We will leverage the powerful deep learning framework Keras to construct and train our model. By following this tutorial, beginners will gain a solid foundation in building and training CNNs for image classification tasks.

Description:
1. Dataset Preparation:
We start by loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image belongs to one of the ten classes.
The dataset is divided into training and test sets, allowing us to evaluate the performance of our trained model accurately.
2. Preprocessing the Data:
Before feeding the images into our model, we perform preprocessing steps to ensure optimal training performance.
We normalize the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1, transforming the images from integer format to floating-point values.
3. Model Architecture:
We define a CNN model using the Sequential API provided by Keras.
The model consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
We use activation functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and softmax to introduce non-linearity and enable multi-class classification.
4. Model Compilation:
Before training, we compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
We use the Adam optimizer, which is widely used for training deep learning models.
For multi-class classification, we employ the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the model's performance during training.
5. Model Training:
We train the model using the fit() method, passing in the training data, labels, number of epochs, and validation data.
The model iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss and improve its predictive performance.
During training, we monitor the validation accuracy to track the model's progress.
6. Model Evaluation:
After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test set using the evaluate() method.
We obtain the test loss and accuracy, providing insights into the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

By following this tutorial, beginners will gain hands-on experience in building and training a CNN model for image classification using Keras. The knowledge and skills acquired here can be extended to more complex datasets and applications. Have fun exploring the fascinating world of image classification and deep learning!
